This is a small GUI to make the configuration of https://github.com/dechamps/FlexASIO a bit quicker.

It should pick up your existing $Usersprofile/FlexASIO.toml file and read the basic parameters. Not all of them have been implemented yet...

Disclaimer: this was written in one late night, so expect 4am code quality ;)

v0.3 adds a registry key with the install path to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Fabrikat\FlexASIOGUI\Install\Installpath

It also makes most settings optional so that default settings are not overwritten.
